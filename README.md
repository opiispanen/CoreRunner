# CoreRunner
CoreRunner is not a framework, more like a frame with a philosophy.

The big idea is to have a bunch of independent components that can be:
  - DOM widgets
  - Data widgets
  - Animation
  - Canvas/WebGL game/animation, whatever
 
And all of these can work in unity having things like data-binding, ansyncronous events etc.
